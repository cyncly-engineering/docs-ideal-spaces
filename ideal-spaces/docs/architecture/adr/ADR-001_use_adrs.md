# Use ADRs to document architecture decisions

## Context
When architecture decisions are taken the context in which they are agreed gets lost over time, either because the
developers that drove the decision leave the team or because over time the developers involved forget the exact
circumstances that led to that decision.

## Decision
Architecture decisions agreed with the whole team should be documented using ADR format used here in our documentation.

## Consequences
* It should help documenting the context in which an architecture decision is taken
* It should help as record for future developers to understand certain architecture features of the system
* It should serve as documentation for future record to help remembering the reasoning behind an architecture decision
