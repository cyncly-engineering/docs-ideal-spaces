# Github Copilot - AI assistant to partner with developers
### Impact factor
augment developer capabilities, enable them to be more productivity, reduce manual tasks and help them to focus on interesting work. 

### Prompt enginneering 
* Understanding of inputs(task, question, information), outputs and parameters 

### Use cases 
* Brainstroming - generates ideas and drafts 
* Task management and desicion making 
* Content generation: Blogs, articles and reports 
* Task delegation and project management

### Ethics and considerations 
* Privacy and data security - Copilot asked for permission to allow MS to scan on end user codebase
* Responsibility and future work
* Average skills cannot produce more than average result
* Missing out on opportunities 
* Optimal outputs is through evaluation and iteratives 
* Manage copilot responsefully 
* Inclusive language 

### Define problems
* Lack of developer standard
* Security concerns 
* Learning and development 
* Automation 
* Quality matrix  

### Set goals (metrics) / values from copilot
* Productivity
    * [DORA Metrics](https://www.leanix.net/en/wiki/vsm/dora-metrics) 
        * Increase (# no. of) deployment frequency - as of today, frequency is in between once per week to one per month
        * Increase (# no. of) lead time for changes 
        * Reduce (in %) change failure rate  
        * MTTR - Reduce (# no. of) defect that impact users 
* Education - individual learner; improve learning journey since, copilot tells learner what to do /teaching assistant for both new and experience programmers get to know multiple solutions for one problem.
* Define developer standards 
* quality - optimize query, algorithm, secure code 
* Reduce bug 
* Fast KT 
* GitHub Copilot suggestions more secure hence, developer can avoid common vulnerable coding patterns including SQL injections, path injections, hardcoded credentials, etc. 
* Easy on migration journey 
* Developer satisfaction (qualitative)
* Stories burnt (in %)
* Code review 
* Code structure, standards

 |  |Metrics for CoPilot Assessment| 
 |Qualitative|Developer Satisfaction/Developer Survey|Perceptual measures about code reviews can reveal whether developers view the work in a good or bad lightâ€”for example if they present learning, mentorship, or opportunities to shape the codebase. With CoPilot does developer spend more time on high end coding effort rather than writing repeated codes or spending time on figuring out the design patterns?
 |Quantitative|Story Point Shipped|# Commits, # Code Reviews. We need to give few quarters of time to find out whether # Story points shipped by developer in a Sprint increases. Also does SP assigned to a story reduces which is a measure of efficience increase.
 | Qualitative|Code Review velocity and quality|Code-review velocity captures the speed of reviews; because this can reflect both how quickly an individual completes a review and the constraints of the team, it is both an individual- and a team-level metric. Also with help of copilot does quality of code review comments improves i.e it talks more about logic and domain comments rather than code structure and documentation. 
 | |4|Code Structure improvement|Can copilot help in ensuring that developers structire the code in similar way which makes it easier for other developers to understand? Also if CoPilot generates the boiler plate code so how much is efficiency gain here.
 | |5|Code Standardization| 
 | |6|Quality of Documentation|Does CoPilot generates the automated comments for different methods and generate clear documentation thus saving developer time as well as ensure that code is easy to understand and KT will take lesser time due to good documentation
 | |7|Knowledge Transfer| 
 | |8|Auto generation of unit test cases - Code testing| 


### Plan your concepts 

### Create a WG working group
Rakesh, Pandurang, Luis, Johannes, Jestha

### Build prototype
* Creating C#, .NET scaffold for structure of project using Copilot 
* Replicate the effort for other tech stack.
* Easy build up boilerplate or script - using Gihub Copilot cli extension 

### Dedicate enough resources 
* Github ecosystem available

### Evaluate results 
* Evaluate Github Copilot ~~Nightly~~ 
* Analyze co-pair programming using Github Copilot chat extension 
* Translate between programming language using Github Copilot lab 
* Evaluated regex pattern 
* Suggested code may not work or even make sense

### Lesson learned (based on assessment done)

### Risk and tolerance 

### Guidelines
* Ensure suitability - testing, IP scanning, check for security vulnerabilities 
* Don't compile before code is reviewed
* Suppress public code suggestions
* Developers are always in charge of - test, review and critical examination
* Developer survey

### Administration
