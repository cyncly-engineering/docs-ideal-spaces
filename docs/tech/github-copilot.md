### Metrics definitions

**Velocity and throughput metrics**

**Throughput** is a core measure of ‘output’ over time for Scrum teams - and can be calculated in tickets, story points, pull requests, builds or value points. This can be expressed as a percentage increase. 

**Sprint Velocity** considers the rate of work achieved within a sprint and how it varies over time.  It can be calculated in tickets or story points. This would be a key metric when considering the impact of GitHub Copilot. 

**Time to value**

**Cycle Time** is a core agile software delivery metric which tracks an organisation’s ability to deliver software early and often.  It calculates the time taken to deliver an increment of software from dev start to deployment.  The shorter the Cycle Time, the shorter the feedback loops, hence the quicker the organisation is going to receive new features and respond to customer needs.  This is a vital KPI when assessing technology delivery efficiency. 

**Code Cycle** Time typically accounts for 20-30% of overall Cycle Time. It calculates the average time taken from a pull request (PRs) opening until it is merged/closed. The bulk of this time is usually spent during the approval process.   
In theory, GitHub CoPilot enables quicker, easier development. Therefore, developers should have greater availability to review each other’s PRs. If code quality is improved, then the outcome of the reviews should result in fewer changes requested and an approval time.

**Quality**

**Escaped Defects** is a simple but effective measure of overall software delivery quality.  It can be tracked in numerous ways, but most involve tracking defects by criticality/priority.   
Any analysis of delivery efficiency pre/post the implementation of GitHub Copilot should include consideration of Escaped Defect rates as it would be a poor trade-off to increase velocity and ‘productivity’ at the expense of quality.   

**Build Failure Rate** identifies the percentage of builds which fail and the overall risk this poses to a team working productively. Notable changes to the failure rate after implementing GitHub Copilot indicate that code quality may be impacted. 

**Dependencies**

**Sprint Target Completion** tracks the percentage of the sprint goals achieved each cycle. ‘Scrum Teams’ and ‘Sprints’ are the basic building blocks of Scrum Agile software delivery.  If Scrum Teams consistently deliver their Sprint goals, Agile software delivery becomes relatively dependable, enabling the prediction of delivery outcomes across multiple teams and longer time periods.   
Scrum team predictability is, therefore, a critical success criterion in Agile software delivery. If GitHub Copilot can improve the likelihood of a team delivering their tickets faster and with fewer bugs, then this is a major contributor to the overall improvement in effectiveness. 

**Developer Satisfaction**

**eNPS** tracks employee satisfaction and loyalty within teams and organisations. An employee NPS makes this straightforward to validate and quantify.
Although an important factor of productivity measurement, it shouldn’t be viewed in isolation from the other metrics when quantifying overall developer productivity. 
The above are some examples of relevant metrics to consider when analysing the impact of GitHub Copilot on delivery productivity.  The key is to take a balanced set of metrics that holistically considers software delivery a complex process.
